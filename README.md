Convolution filters with shaders in processing
Online presentation available [here](https://jdtorregrosas.github.io/processing-convolution/#/themes)

## Goals
* Comprehend the way that filters works, by studying the convolution matrix theory.
* Design a Processing library to apply distinct filters to images and videos by using the convolution matrix.
